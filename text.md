Problem: 
The Swedish government is currently doing expensive investments and coactions to strengthen Life Science Sweden with a goal to become a world-leading nation of the future. If Sweden succeed it will make important society profits such as increased export revenues, a lot of job opportunities,  and an unique access to innovative healthcare. One of the most exciting ongining investment is the so called health tech ecosystems aimed to enable rewarding cooperation between the industry, academia and healthcare. The consensus of the new way of coworking is necessary to achieve the goal in a cost-saving and accelerated approach. However, Labbrock has identified a fundamental problem – weak lab communication – that will prevent the expected exchange of success. Labbrock has come up with an easy-implemented business idea based on a social innovation with costickers. By adding costickers on white coats and ID-cards it will create the needed prerequisites for the new way of coworking in labs. The costickers will encourage focused and accelerated coworking with an open and helpful attitude of sharing competences and tech resources with DECT – delight, empowerment, compassion, transparency – which are the soft skills of the future for social sustainability in high performance work cultures within Life Science.
 

USP:  
The use of stickers in business is common, but the use of costickers as a coworking tool in a accelerated, focused and helpful approach while encourage social sustainability is unique – especially within labs and Life Science.
